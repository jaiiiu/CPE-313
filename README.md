# CPE-313 - Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Course Description
This course provides a broad introduction to prediction, machine learning and deep learning . This course also includes machine learning algorithms to solve clustering, regression and classification problems. The course also provides basic understanding of modern neural networks and their applications in computer vision , time series and natural language understanding. The topics also includes building blocks of neural networks  transfer learning, different network architectures, CNN and RNN.

## Repository Overview
This repository serves as a centralized hub for all my hands-on activities throughout the course. Each activity will be organized into separate folders, making it easy to navigate and locate specific assignments. The goal is to create a structured and collaborative environment where I can showcase my progress and learnings.

## Student Introduction
Hello, I am **Jaison Martin Zapanta**, a dedicated college student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Technological Institute of the Philippines. This repository will document my journey as I work through various hands-on activities, applying theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

Feel free to explore my code, experiments, and reflections on the challenges faced during this learning process. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!

## Feedback and Collaboration
I welcome collaboration and feedback! If you have ideas, suggestions, or you just want to discuss a concept further, feel free to open an issue or reach out through email [qjmzapanta1@tip.edu.ph].
